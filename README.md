# 🌱 AgroVision – Farm Management System (Java)

## 📌 Project Overview

**AgroVision** is a Java-based farm management system developed using Object-Oriented Programming concepts. The system helps farmers monitor and manage crop resources efficiently by tracking water and fertilizer levels, automating irrigation processes, and generating detailed reports.

This project was developed as part of an academic module to demonstrate practical implementation of Java OOP principles.
